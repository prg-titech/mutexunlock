# internal/ctrlflow

This is a fork of `golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/ctrlflow`. Since original `cfg` package does not have position information for block, forked.  
This `ctrlflow` package uses `internal/cfg` instead of that.

Original codes are here: https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/tools/+/refs/tags/v0.1.8:go/analysis/passes/ctrlflow/;drc=1c6f3cc33f0f7d8dfe151a0bba849bc6bf40ca3b
